README (CInhibit)

    CInhibit is a simplified C port of the Inhibit project which is used to
    prevent the accidental execution of critical commands (e.g. to shutdown
    or reboot the system). For details see:

        https://github.com/urbanware-org/inhibit

    Other than Inhibit, this port only provides its base functionality without
    any customization options (such as custom header or colors) via config
    file. So, there is just the hostname to confirm the command execution (no
    random strings) and there also is no functionality to prevent the control
    of services via 'systemctl' the way Inhibit has.

    This repository does not include binaries. So, in order to use CInhibit,
    you have to compile it using the included 'compile.sh' script.

    CInhibit requires the 'libreadline-dev' package (or 'readline-devel'
    depending on the operating system). If the requirements are met, simply
    run the compile script:

        ./compile.sh

    In order to use the program simply run the binary, which should already be
    executable. If not (for whatever reason) you can set the executable flag
    as follows:

        chmod +x cinhibit

    Usage examples:

        cinhibit --version      (to return the version number)

        cinhibit reboot         (to inhibit e.g. the 'reboot' command)

    The project was written on Linux and should run on any Unix-like system
    (without any warranty).

    CInhibit is and was not intended to be or become an actual alternative to
    Inhibit. It is just a simple a port to the C programming language for
    experimental as well as (more or less) educational purposes.

    Feel free to fork.
